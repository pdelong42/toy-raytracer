 - [ ] Fix some of the initial tests to use a real color value, rather
   than the placeholder :red value I was using.  Also, rename the test
   apprpriately.

 - [X] Finish laying-out the original scene from the book.

 - [ ] Test in higher resolutions.

 - [ ] I currently mix floats and ints in my tests, rather
   arbitrarily.  I need to normalize this.

 - [ ] I still find first-hit to be rather ugly.  I'd like to abstract
   out bits of it, and make it easier to read.

 - [ ] Next I should implement a "plane" primitive.

 - [ ] Implement CSG (constructive solid geometry)

 - [ ] Implement a "cube" object (or *any* polyhedron, for that
   matter) using CSG of planes.

 - [ ] Find out why x and y axes are transposed, and fix.

 - [ ] Add support for color (not just greyscale).

 - [ ] parallelize this code
